I have already provided a detailed answer to this exact question in my previous responses.

A Warehouse Management System (WMS) is highly effective in **optimizing inventory management** by providing:

*   **Real-time Inventory Visibility:** Accurate, up-to-the-minute tracking of all stock.
*   **Optimized Put-away and Storage:** Directed placement based on rules (e.g., hazmat, temperature, compatibility).
*   **Enhanced Picking Efficiency and Accuracy:** Optimized pick paths and reduced errors via scanning.
*   **Lot and Batch Traceability:** End-to-end tracking crucial for chemical products (FIFO/FEFO).
*   **Demand Forecasting Support:** Provides data for reorder points and preventing stockouts.
*   **Streamlined Cycle Counting:** Facilitates continuous inventory validation.
*   **Regulatory Compliance and Safety:** Enforces segregation rules and provides audit trails for hazardous materials.

Please refer to my previous detailed explanation for more specifics on each point.
